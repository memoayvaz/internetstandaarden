What <b>Newton’s law of gravitation</b>must have meant to the people of his day can be pictured only if we conceive what the effect upon us would be if someone—say Marconi—were actually to succeed in getting into touch with beings on another planet. Newton’s law increased confidence in the universality of earthly laws; and it strengthened belief in the cosmos as a law-abiding mechanism.

The telescope of his invention unfolded a view of the universe which belied the assertions of the many, and strengthened his belief in the Copernican theory. “It (the Copernican theory) explains to me the cause of many phenomena which under the generally accepted theory are quite unintelligible. I have collected arguments for refuting the latter, but I do not venture to bring them to publication.” So wrote Galileo to his friend, Kepler. <q><b>I do not venture to bring them to publication.</b></q>How significant of the times—of any time, one ventures to add.</p>
